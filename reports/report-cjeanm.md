### Report :

#### May 14 - 27, 2022:

Over the past few weeks there have been many discussions about the technical side of the app, what it needs to do and what needs to be implemented.
We had meetings with the EER and the organization Genome Quebec to discuss their needs.

Following the discussions, we developed user stories for the project.

Here are some examples:
- As an administrator, I want to see and modify all labels in order to correct errors in the label data.
- As a {student, teacher, administrator}, I want to see and compare all labels in order to explore the work of others.
- As {student, teacher, administrator}, I want to view statistics of all the labels in order to see an overall portrait of the labels and the project.

#### 30 may - 10 june 2022 :

During this period, I did several technical tasks to prepare for the start of development:
Here's an enumeration :
- I created this site to document the progress and describe the project.
- Design and preparation of the basic shell/structure of the code with the objective of preserving maintainability over time. The structure is inspired by the MVC model (model-view-controller).
- Describe the preliminary techniques to start the application and contribute to the project.
- Creation of a basic [design document](/projet-IFT3150/extra/endPoints.html) to elaborate the different endpoints that reflects different user stories.
- Designed a UI [prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/PKpWv1xNZZSQ9bKw9wtKBu/Geo-app) to provide suggestions.
