##  CS project

Supported by the Quebec Ministry of Education, the Network School's mission is to enrich the educational environment through interclass activities related to the Quebec School Training Program. These activities reach nearly 300,000 students in all regions of Quebec and elsewhere in the world.

The objective of the project will be to set up an online learning platform (LMS) supported by geographic information systems (GIS). Analyze student needs related to digital skills and subject-specific skills. Create a first educational project using this new platform, for example, a citizen science application. The tool must be designed taking into account the sustainability and maintainability of the project.

This project is aimed at the collaboration of 3rd cycle elementary students and/or secondary school students in Quebec. The latter will be able to collect data, test the tool developed and share their comments and suggestions. The Network School (Ã‰ER) will coordinate with schools and students. Skills targeted at primary and secondary level: Digital skills, subject-specific skills (mathematics, science and technology - social sciences)

The projects are under the direction of [Michalis Famelis](https://michalis.famelis.info/), [Emma Frejinger](https://www.emmafrejinger.org/) and coordinated by [Robin Milosz](http://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/~miloszro/).
